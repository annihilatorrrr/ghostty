# AFL++ Fuzzer for Libghostty

This directory contains [AFL++](https://aflplus.plus/) fuzzing harnesses for
libghostty-vt (Zig module).

## Fuzz Targets

| Target             | Binary             | Description                                             |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fuzz-vt-parser`   | `fuzz-vt-parser`   | VT parser only (`Parser.next` byte-at-a-time)           |
| `fuzz-vt-stream`   | `fuzz-vt-stream`   | Full terminal stream (`nextSlice` + `next` via handler)  |

The stream target creates a small `Terminal` and exercises the readonly
`Stream` handler, covering printing, CSI dispatch, OSC, DCS, SGR, cursor
movement, scrolling regions, and more. The first byte of each input selects
between the slice path (SIMD fast-path) and the scalar path.

## Prerequisites

Install AFL++ so that `afl-cc` and `afl-fuzz` are on your `PATH`.

- **macOS (Homebrew):** `brew install aflplusplus`
- **Linux:** build from source or use your distro's package (e.g.
  `apt install afl++` on Debian/Ubuntu).

## Building

From this directory (`test/fuzz-libghostty`):

```sh
zig build
```

This compiles Zig static libraries for each fuzz target, emits LLVM bitcode,
then links each with `afl.c` using `afl-cc` to produce instrumented binaries
at `zig-out/bin/fuzz-vt-parser` and `zig-out/bin/fuzz-vt-stream`.

## Running the Fuzzer

Each target has its own run step:

```sh
zig build run-fuzz-vt-parser    # Run the VT parser fuzzer
zig build run-fuzz-vt-stream    # Run the VT stream fuzzer
zig build run                   # Alias for run-fuzz-vt-parser
```

Or invoke `afl-fuzz` directly:

```sh
afl-fuzz -i corpus/vt-stream-initial -o afl-out/fuzz-vt-stream -- zig-out/bin/fuzz-vt-stream @@
```

The fuzzer runs indefinitely. Let it run for as long as you like; meaningful
coverage is usually reached within a few hours, but longer runs can find
deeper bugs. Press `ctrl+c` to stop the fuzzer when you're done.

## Finding Crashes and Hangs

After (or during) a run, results are written to `afl-out/<target>/default/`:

```
afl-out/fuzz-vt-stream/default/
├── crashes/ # Inputs that triggered crashes
├── hangs/   # Inputs that triggered hangs/timeouts
└── queue/   # All interesting inputs (the evolved corpus)
```

Each file in `crashes/` or `hangs/` is a raw byte file that triggered the
issue. The filename encodes metadata about how it was found (e.g.
`id:000000,sig:06,...`).

## Reproducing a Crash

Replay any crashing input by piping it into the harness:

```sh
cat afl-out/fuzz-vt-stream/default/crashes/<filename> | zig-out/bin/fuzz-vt-stream
```

## Corpus Management

After a fuzzing run, the queue in `afl-out/<target>/default/queue/` typically
contains many redundant inputs. Use `afl-cmin` to find the smallest
subset that preserves full edge coverage, and `afl-tmin` to shrink
individual test cases.

> **Important:** The instrumented binary reads input from **stdin**, not
> from file arguments. Do **not** use `@@` with `afl-cmin`, `afl-tmin`,
> or `afl-showmap` — it will cause them to see only the C harness
> coverage (~4 tuples) instead of the Zig VT parser coverage.

### Corpus minimization (`afl-cmin`)

Reduce the evolved queue to a minimal set covering all discovered edges:

```sh
AFL_NO_FORKSRV=1 afl-cmin.bash \
  -i afl-out/fuzz-vt-stream/default/queue \
  -o corpus/vt-stream-cmin \
  -- zig-out/bin/fuzz-vt-stream
```

`AFL_NO_FORKSRV=1` is required because the Python `afl-cmin` wrapper has
a bug in AFL++ 4.35c. Use the `afl-cmin.bash` script instead (typically
found in AFL++'s `libexec` directory).

### Test case minimization (`afl-tmin`)

Shrink each file in the minimized corpus to the smallest input that
preserves its unique coverage:

```sh
mkdir -p corpus/vt-stream-min
for f in corpus/vt-stream-cmin/*; do
  AFL_NO_FORKSRV=1 afl-tmin \
    -i "$f" \
    -o "corpus/vt-stream-min/$(basename "$f")" \
    -- zig-out/bin/fuzz-vt-stream
done
```

This is slow (hundreds of executions per file) but produces the most
compact corpus. It can be skipped if you only need edge-level
deduplication from `afl-cmin`.

### Windows compatibility

AFL++ output filenames contain colons (e.g., `id:000024,time:0,...`), which
are invalid on Windows (NTFS). After running `afl-cmin` or `afl-tmin`,
rename the output files to replace colons with underscores before committing:

```sh
./corpus/sanitize-filenames.sh
```

### Corpus directories

| Directory                  | Contents                                        |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `corpus/initial/`          | Hand-written seed inputs for vt-parser           |
| `corpus/vt-parser-cmin/`   | Output of `afl-cmin` (edge-deduplicated corpus) |
| `corpus/vt-stream-initial/`| Hand-written seed inputs for vt-stream           |
